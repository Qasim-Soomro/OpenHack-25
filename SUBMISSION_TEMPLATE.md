# 🧠 OpenHack'25 – Project Submission Guide 

Welcome, hackers! 🎉
Follow this guide carefully to submit your project for OpenHack'25.
Your submission here should **only include your code, model, and technical components.**
🖼️ *Visuals (like screenshots, UI demos, or videos) will be collected separately through the submission form.*

---

## 📁 Step 1: Fork the Repo

1. Go to the official repo: [OpenHack'25 Hackathon Repo](https://github.com/OpenHack-25/Hack)
2. Click **"Fork"** to create your own copy.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create Your Project Folder

Inside your forked repo, create a folder using this format:

```
TeamName_ProjectName/
```

✅ Example:

```
CodeWarriors_AI-Waste-Classifier/
```

Your folder must include:

```
CodeWarriors_AI-Waste-Classifier/
├── README.md
├── /src              (source code)
├── /model            (ML model, if used)
├── requirements.txt  (or package.json)
└── main.py / app.js / index.ipynb
```

💡 *No need to include UI designs, screenshots, or videos — only working code and models.*

---

## 🧾 Step 3: Add a README.md

Each project must include a `README.md` file like this:

````markdown
# 🌟 Project Title
AI Waste Classifier

## 👥 Team Name
CodeWarriors

## 🧑‍💻 Team Members
- Alice – [@alicehub](https://github.com/alicehub)
- Bob – [@bobdev](https://github.com/bobdev)

## 💡 Problem Statement
Explain the problem your code or model solves.

## 🚀 Solution
Describe your approach — how your logic, algorithm, or model works.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python  
Libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy  
Tools: GitHub Actions, Docker (if used)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Hack.git
   ```

2. Navigate to your project:
   ```bash
   cd Hack/CodeWarriors_AI-Waste-Classifier
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🏆 Category
Energy & Climate Change

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
Briefly describe one or two technical challenges and how you solved them.

## 📚 Learnings
What you learned while building your model or logic.

## 📜 License

## 📤 Step 4: Push to Your Fork

Once done, push your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added CodeWarriors AI Waste Classifier project"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔁 Step 5: Submit Your Entry

Go to the official [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/form)
and paste your folder link, for example: (soon)

```
https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Hack/tree/main/CodeWarriors_AI-Waste-Classifier
```

🖼️ *You'll also upload visuals, screenshots, or demo videos in this form — not in the GitHub repo.*

---

## ✅ Rules

* Include only **code, logic, or models** — no UI or visuals here.
* Make sure your code **runs without errors.**
* Your **README must explain your logic and setup clearly.**
* Submissions missing README or dependencies will not be reviewed.
* Deadline: *October 14, 2025 - 11:59 AM*
