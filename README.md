2. **Choose Wisely** – You can only join **one team**.  
3. **Final Commitment** – Once registration closes, **no team changes are allowed**.  
4. **Bring Your Gear** – Ensure you bring your **laptop** fully charged for the hackathon.  
5. **Play Nice** – Organizers reserve the right to **disqualify teams** for unsportsmanlike behavior.
